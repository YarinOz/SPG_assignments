or :scanf("%d", &nextFloor); what is the value of nextfloor if the input is A

github_copilot:
The scanf function in C attempts to read and convert input according to the format specifier provided. In this case, the %d format specifier is used, which expects an integer.

If you input a non-integer value like 'A' when scanf("%d", &nextFloor); is expecting an integer, the function will fail to convert the input and nextFloor will not be updated. This means nextFloor will retain its previous value, or be uninitialized if it hasn't been assigned a value before.

Additionally, the non-integer input will remain in the input buffer, which could cause issues with subsequent input operations. It's generally a good idea to validate and clear the input buffer after a scanf operation to prevent such issues.

me:
How can I clear the input buffer after a failed scanf operation in C?

github_copilot:
You can clear the input buffer in C using a simple loop that reads and discards characters until a newline character or EOF (End of File) is encountered. Here's how you can do it:
int c;
while ((c = getchar()) != '\n' && c != EOF) { }

This loop uses getchar() to read characters one by one from the input buffer. If scanf fails to read an integer, the loop will remove the invalid input from the buffer.
